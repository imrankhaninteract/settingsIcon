The main gear animation is structured using a container with a class name parent and a gear element with a class name gear
The gear itself is a circular shape with a white background color and a specified width, height, and border radius to create the circular 
shape
Within the gear, there is a center element represented by a div with the class name center This element has a specific position, size, and 
background color to create the center part of the gear
The gear also consists of four teeth elements represented by divs with the class name tooth Each tooth has a specified position, size, and 
background color to create the teeth of the gear
Each tooth element is positioned absolutely and rotated using the transform   rotate   deg       property to achieve the gear like 
appearance
The animation for the gear spinning is defined using keyframes named spin The animation specifies the rotation of the gear from 0 degrees 
to 360 degrees continuously
The animation duration, iteration count, and timing function are also specified within the CSS code
Overall, the HTML and CSS code work together to create an animated gear spinning effect on the webpage against a background image, 
giving a visually appealing display
